 # About and Metadata
 I build this repo to try out interactive charts in R Shiny. Most of this project was built using GPT 4.0 as I haven't learned R yet but still wanted to try things out. The data involved is population in U.S. Metro Areas (CBSAs) from 2015-2022. It is Census data (ACS and Decennial), from [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) and was restructured to one .csv using Python. The background of how to host on Github Pages came from this great [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@rami.krispin/deploy-shiny-app-on-github-pages-b4cbd433bdc).
